run_heavy.py — Phase 4a heavy-tier scanner (v1)

v1 SCOPE (locked per RUN_HEAVY_V1_BUILD_SPEC.md + HEAVY_TIER_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.md):
  - testssl.sh   — TLS depth (handshake-level; WAF-immune)
  - naabu        — port discovery (PENDING in this commit — P4)
  - fingerprintx — service ID on open ports (PENDING in this commit — P4)

  NOT v1: nmap (v1.1, image rebuild), ZAP / Playwright DAST (v2).

WHY THIS EXISTS:
  The note-127 auto-closer (asm_autoclose_stale_findings) can't reconcile
  the ~85-finding stranded testssl backlog (incl. the only 3 open MODERATES)
  until a producer tool re-scans those assets — and testssl runs heavy-only.
  v1 unblocks that backlog clearing.

THE load-bearing identity decision (RATIFIED by Howie 2026-06-29):
  Heavy MUST NOT mint its own testssl identity. Reusing the offline parser
  (`cs_parsers/testssl.py::parse_testssl_file`) is what makes a re-scan of
  a still-present issue bump the EXISTING `source='testssl'` row's
  last_observed_at — which is what the note-127 auto-closer keys on. Mint
  a different identity here and a re-scan looks like "tool ran, didn't see
  the old finding" → auto-closer false-closes a live finding + creates a
  duplicate. Unacceptable for a security tool.

  Consequence: run_heavy emits `FindingEvent` (not `MediumFinding`), and
  the writer below (`write_event_findings_and_artifacts`) reads
  `source`/`finding_id` from each FindingEvent rather than hardcoding
  them. ADR-001 scanner_version + derive_validation_status() stamping
  preserved from run_medium's writer pattern.

  Net-depth findings (naabu/fingerprintx, P4) have no offline-import twin
  and may use source='commandsentry_heavy'. They won't auto-close until a
  commandsentry_heavy producer-map entry is added to
  asm_autoclose_producer_patterns — fine for v1.

EXACT testssl.sh INVOCATION (settled with Howie's Mac runbook):
  testssl.sh --warnings batch --color 0 \\
             --jsonfile <out.json> --htmlfile <out.html> \\
             https://<host>

  Hard rules:
    - NO --severity flag. It filters the JSON output; a filtered rescan
      vs a full-pass original-import → the auto-closer sees filtered
      rows as "not observed" → false-closes live findings.
    - --jsonfile (NOT --jsonfile-pretty). parse_testssl_file reads the
      flat record array `[{id, ip, port, severity, finding}, ...]`.
      --jsonfile-pretty emits a different nested structure the parser
      won't read.
    - --warnings batch suppresses interactive "press Enter" prompts.

USAGE:
  python scripts/scanner/run_heavy.py /tmp/scan_descriptor.json

ENVIRONMENT:
  SUPABASE_DSN — required (or pass --dsn)
  SKIP_VPN     — validate-mode interlock (heavy carries the same
                 batch-2 step-d semantic; non-allowlisted targets fail
                 closed under skip_vpn=true).

EXIT CODES:
  0 — scan ran (findings written, scan_run closed). Findings may be 0
      (no TLS on host is a valid negative — see testssl_is_degraded).
      Also returned for routine ROE refusals (workflow stays green).
  1 — fatal error (DB unreachable, descriptor invalid, missing tool
      at runtime, etc.). scan_run is marked 'failed' before exit.
      ROE fail-closed on uncertainty also exits 1 (workflow goes red).
  3 — degraded cascade (testssl flaked beyond recovery, validate-mode
      refused the target, etc.). scan_run marked 'degraded'.

BUILD STATUS (this file, 2026-06-29):
  [x] P0 — workflow branch unstubbed (scanner.yml)
  [x] P1 — skeleton (this module)
  [x] P2 — testssl invocation + FindingEvent writer + parse_testssl_file bridge
  [x] P3 — testssl_is_degraded (basic). Comprehensive unit tests = follow-up.
  [ ] P4 — naabu / fingerprintx net depth (follow-up)
  [ ] P5 — validated-SHA proof on demo.testfire.net (operational)
  [ ] P6 — wild-parity dry-run vs Mac testssl (operational)
  [ ] P7 — enable on backlog assets (CMI, Unimac) (operational)

    + TLS scan ran to completion — auto-closer can credit coverage)
    from a DEGRADED run (timeout, binary missing, unparseable JSON,
    host-unreachable, OR truncated mid-scan → scan_run must NOT be
    'complete'). The note-127 auto-closer treats a complete scan whose
    tools_run includes 'testssl.sh' as evidence of remediation on every
    previously-observed testssl finding for that asset. A flaky-but-
    mislabeled-complete run → false-close of live findings.

    EVOLUTION:
      - 87f09d4 — JSON shape only. Hole: engine_problem-only output
        read as valid-negative.
      - e9340ff — count records that survive parser drop list. Over-
        corrected: reachable+remediated hosts produce only INFO/OK
        reach records → 0 eligible → falsely degraded → backlog for
        clean hosts never clears.
      - 4c149cd — reach-based (service / TLS1_x) + diagnostic wins
        unconditionally. Over-corrected differently: real complete
        testssl scans routinely carry one `engine_problem` WARN
        (OCSP hiccup / STARTTLS quirk), so "diagnostic wins" flagged
        essentially every real scan as degraded — proven by live
        heavy run #794 against demo.testfire.net (rc=0, 195-record
        scan, mis-degraded by the e_p WARN).
      - THIS (round 4) — judge by testssl's own COMPLETION MARKERS,
        not by diagnostic noise. testssl emits `overall_grade` and/or
        `scanTime` records at end-of-run; their presence means the
        scan ran to completion regardless of any non-fatal e_p WARN
        encountered along the way. Reach guards the "did we even
        reach the host" axis; completion guards the "did we finish
        the test battery" axis. Engine_problem / scanProblem records
        are NOT a standalone degrade trigger anymore — the truncation
        guard (reach without completion) catches the truly-interrupted
        case without false-positiving on every real scan.

    Detection order:
      - Tool not found / binary missing                    → DEGRADED
      - Subprocess timed out (rc == 124)                   → DEGRADED
      - Output file missing / 0 bytes / unparseable JSON   → DEGRADED
      - Non-list root (e.g. --jsonfile-pretty mistake)     → DEGRADED
      - has_reach AND has_completion                       → OK
        (even with engine_problem / scanProblem records —
        non-fatal diagnostic noise routine in real scans)

# from round 8) but testssl itself still fails post-VPN-bring-up. We

# Per 4.8's Part 1 spec: STOP GUESSING. Add three instrumentation
# surfaces; let the next live run tell us what's happening; THEN fix.
#
#   1. run_pre_testssl_probes — diagnostic block that runs BEFORE
#      testssl. getent v4/v6, ip route get for both, curl -4/-6 HEAD,
#      openssl s_client -4 raw handshake. Splits the v4-vs-v6 and
#      isolates testssl from openssl. Best-effort, never raises —
#      probe failures don't block the scan; the log lines are the
#      product.
#
#   2. _log_stderr_tail — print last N lines of testssl's stderr on
#      every run (success or degrade). Catches non-fatal warnings
#      we're currently dropping on the floor + provides forensic
#      context on degrades without needing a second run.
#
#   3. _dump_small_testssl_json — when the jsonfile is suspiciously
#      small (<4KB) on a degraded exit, log its full contents AND
#      extract any engine_problem / scanProblem records' finding
#      text. testssl's degraded output usually puts the actual
#      error in scanProblem.finding — this dumps the smoking gun
#      directly to the runner log instead of hoping somebody fetches
#      the artifact later.

# in heavy — the TLS cert O/CN and the asset's response headers + Set-Cookie NAMES
# — and stores them RAW as one `stack_id_passive` scan_run artifact. It does NOT
# feed the classifier: P1 will read this artifact (via gather_observations, exactly
# like the fingerprint/testssl artifacts) and wire the signals into device_class /
# vendor_product under a SINGLE soak reset. That collect-vs-wire separation is what
# keeps P0 additive / no-reset (4.7 R2).

# and emits NO findings — it only appends an artifact. So it cannot perturb
# close_out's tool-completeness invariant or the note-127 autocloser, and a total
# failure just yields an artifact with no signals (zero blast radius).
#
# Set-Cookie: NAMES only, never values — the name (cookiesession1 = FortiWeb,
# incap_ses = Imperva, ak_bm = Akamai, AWSALB = AWS ELB, ...) is the vendor
# fingerprint; the value is session material we do not persist.

# Spec: HEAVY_PHASE1_NETDEPTH_SPEC v2 + HEAVY_PHASE1_BUILD_DELTA (4.7 D1-D5).
#
# These two phases are a PAIR. run() credits tools_run with BOTH 'naabu' AND
# 'fingerprintx' ONLY when both pass their four-gate (4.7 D1 all-or-nothing
# autoclose credit) — so, UNLIKE run_httpx_phase, they do NOT self-register in
# tools_run / tool_status; run() does it after the pair returns. If either
# degrades, findings still emit (observations recorded) but neither name enters
# tools_run, so the note-127 autocloser never false-closes the OTHER tool's
# commandsentry_heavy findings on a partial scan.
#
# Findings-only (4.7 D3): heavy MUST NOT write asset_surface — the discovery
# importer owns asset_surface.service_count, which the P2 went-dark writer reads;
# a heavy dual-writer could feed a false zero-service into that lifecycle.
# source='commandsentry_heavy' ALWAYS (NEVER 'naabu'/'fingerprintx' — those are
# not finding_source_t labels; emitting them fails the insert). Identity excludes
# the service (4.7 D4): finding_id is stable per (asset, source, port, proto); the
# service is mutable TITLE metadata so a fingerprintx flap re-observes, not churns.

# Regress-on-observed (centralized via SQL helper — round 6)
# ============================================================================
#
# Note 129 round 6 / migration 20260629a: the regression logic was
# centralized into a SQL function that both medium + heavy call —
# regress_observed_for_scan_run(p_scan_run_id, p_source). It mirrors
# delta_close_for_scan_run as a structural sibling:
#   delta_close:  current_status IN open      AND last_seen <> this
#                 → mark remediated
#   regress:      current_status IN remediated AND last_seen =  this
#                 → mark regressed (+ clear remediated_at)
#
# Both clauses are mutually exclusive (open-set vs remediated-set, <>
# vs =) so disjoint, order-independent, and idempotent. The SQL fn
# writes one admin_audit_log row per flip (rule=
# 'regress_observed_for_scan_run_v1') and captures the prior status
# via a CTE so the audit before_state is accurate.
#
# Heavy's previous Python helper (regress_observed_remediated +
# _SELECT_OBSERVED_REMEDIATED_SQL + _REGRESS_FINDING_SQL) was retired
# in this round — the SQL function is the single source of truth.
# Call site lives in run() below: clean path only, one SELECT per
# distinct source observed in ctx.findings (today: 'testssl'; future
# net-depth P4 adds 'commandsentry_heavy').
#
# CLEAN-PATH ONLY discipline preserved — never call from the
# degraded except branch. A degraded scan isn't trustworthy evidence
# of presence (it can't credit "I saw it" against an existing
# remediated finding).
#
# Why scope per-source: a heavy scan emits findings under multiple
# sources (canonical 'testssl' for TLS depth, 'commandsentry_heavy'
# for net depth). Source-scoping the SQL call mirrors delta_close's
# discipline — closes/reopens stay confined to what THIS source
# actually emitted, so an unrelated source's findings can't be
# touched by accident.
