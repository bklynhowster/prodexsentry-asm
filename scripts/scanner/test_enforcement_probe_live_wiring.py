"""(354a-FIRE / relay 366) The SECOND live wire: the dispatch input -> the env.

⛔ THE GAP THIS CLOSES. 360 carried the per-asset flag to the descriptor, but
`ENFORCEMENT_PROBE_LIVE` is read from the RUNNER ENV (enforcement_probe.py) and
nothing in scanner.yml ever set it — no dispatch input, no env block. So
probe_is_authorised always saw env-absent and every run stayed dry-run no matter
what the flag said. Same shape as the descriptor gap, one layer out.

⛔ THE ASSERTION THAT MATTERS IS *WHERE*. probe_enforcement runs inside
run_light.py. ACTIVE_PROBE_LIVE — the fwbbot sibling this mirrors — sits on the
HEAVY step because that probe runs in run_heavy.py. Wire this one to the heavy
step and it is still permanently dry-run, silently. So these tests do not ask
"does ENFORCEMENT_PROBE_LIVE appear in scanner.yml" (presence-anywhere, which a
comment or the wrong step would satisfy). They parse the YAML, find the step
that actually invokes run_light.py, and assert the env key is in THAT step.

⭐ CRON IS NOW ARMED (2026-09-27, Howie's explicit fleet-wide authorization).
This file previously pinned `|| 'false'`, which made the scheduled path
permanently dry-run. Correct while no asset was opted in; it became the thing
preventing the feature from working once the fleet was authorized. The chain is
now `input || vars.ENFORCEMENT_PROBE_LIVE || 'true'`, so a scheduled run arms the
FLEET half and the per-asset flag is the only remaining gate. These tests assert
that shape, and still assert — against the real probe_is_authorised — that an
asset WITHOUT the flag is denied no matter what the fleet half says.
