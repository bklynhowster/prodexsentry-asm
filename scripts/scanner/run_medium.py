run_medium.py — Phase 4a M6/M7b Medium tier scanner

Consumes a scan descriptor (produced by poll_queue.py), runs the Medium
tier check suite against the asset, writes findings + raw artifacts to
Supabase, and closes out the scan_run.

MEDIUM TIER PHILOSOPHY (refined 2026-05-30):
  • Active checks — nuclei, nikto, ffuf — quiet-tuned so we don't
    trip target WAFs as the PRIMARY defense.
  • Runs from inside Mullvad VPN egress (scanner.yml wraps the
    invocation with vpn_bringup.sh + vpn_teardown.sh for Medium+).
  • Builds on top of Light — assumes Light already ran or will run
    independently. Medium does NOT re-do TLS cert / header / DNS /
    common-paths checks.

AGGRESSIVE ROTATION LAYER (new in this version):
  Mullvad's atomic region-swap is effectively free (1-2s, verified
  drill #10). We leverage it to rotate egress IP between tool chunks,
  so each chunk runs from a different exit IP. This means:
    - Single-IP WAF reputation never accumulates enough to ban us
    - If a chunk DOES get banned mid-flight, the next chunk's already
      on a new IP — bounded loss
    - Rotation cost ~1-2s × ~10 rotations = 10-20s overhead in a
      15-min scan (<3%)

  Four protection layers against WAF bans:
    1. Pre-chunk healthcheck (curl baseline before scanner starts)
    2. Small chunks (30-50 URLs each) so mid-chunk ban damage is bounded
    3. Rewind window — when ban detected, mark recent N seconds of
       'completed' URLs as suspect for re-scan on the next chunk
    4. Kill + rotate + requeue — bounded recovery, finding-upsert
       handles dedup automatically

CHECKS RUN (in order):
  1. wafw00f      — WAF pre-check, gates intrusive nuclei templates
  2. nuclei       — chunked, quiet (-rate-limit 30 -c 5)
  3. ffuf         — chunked, quiet (-rate 50 -p 0.1-0.3), top dirs
  4. nikto        — single pass, no chunking (incompatible)

USAGE:
  python scripts/scanner/run_medium.py /tmp/scan_descriptor.json

ENVIRONMENT:
  SUPABASE_DSN — required (or pass --dsn)

EXIT CODES:
  0 — scan ran (findings written, scan_run closed). Findings may be 0.
  1 — fatal error (DB unreachable, descriptor invalid, etc.). scan_run
      is marked 'failed' before exit.
  3 — WAF block cascade detected and no rotation recovered. scan_run
      marked 'failed' with explicit error_message.

# the commit that ADDS a SHA to the in-code list is itself a new commit

# future run writes 'unvalidated' — backfill stamps one run, then
# nothing validates again. Silent no-op.
#
# Moving the allowlist out of hashed code breaks the self-reference:
# validating a SHA is an INSERT, not a commit. HEAD doesn't move. The
# running SHA can validate itself. Real code changes still produce new
# SHAs that run 'unvalidated' until proven AND explicitly INSERTed —

    INFO noise floor.

    Matrix:

    The `url` parameter is currently unused — kept in the signature so a
    future enrichment that checks the response URL (e.g. for path traversal
    in the redirect) can land without a call-site change.

# that cries wolf on healthy runs trains the team to ignore 'degraded' and
# defeats the regime.

# completion (no fake timer). close_out remains the authoritative final
# write — these flushes are additive and best-effort: any DB failure is
# logged and swallowed so the scan continues regardless.

# Architectural note: flush_progress opens its OWN short-lived autocommit

        "auth_gated"  — target is an IdP login page, no unauth attack surface

    LOAD-BEARING distinction: a SKIPPED tool is NOT degraded. The scan
    correctly chose not to run it because it cannot produce useful output
    against this target class. Routing skipped to degraded would re-create
    the "degraded flag means tool worked within its budget" anti-pattern
    (see nikto_is_degraded docstring on the target_error_limit split).
    The 2026-06-15 [1] fix established three states for accurate
    forensics; this 2026-06-15 #24 fix extends that to the skip case.

    Set-equality invariant: callers MUST append to tools_run BEFORE
    calling this (same lockstep as mark_tool_degraded). assert_tool_
    status_invariant is value-blind on the set check, so "skipped"
    entries satisfy it as long as the key is present.

    scan_quality semantics: a run with only ok + skipped statuses stays
    scan_quality='clean'. degraded_out is only triggered by raise
    DegradedRunError, which mark_tool_skipped DOES NOT raise. Therefore
    findings from auth-gated runs (wafw00f + httpx + nuclei[tech])
    remain validatable, which is correct — those tools' output IS clean,
    we just chose not to run the others.

def nikto_is_degraded(stdout: str, stderr: str, rc: int) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """Bug D + Bug E detector. Reads BOTH stdout AND stderr.

    Catches two recognized failure shapes:

    1. **help_text_returned** (original Bug D, 2026-06-07 AM): nikto
       prints its short usage banner on Getopt::Long flag rejection
       or ambiguity. Keys on the EXACT phrases in nikto's short help.
       Banner can land on either stream depending on nikto version.

    2. **runtime_error** (Bug E, added 2026-06-07 PM after scan_run
       c14e2fe2 exposed the blind spot): nikto can scan the target,
       print a valid header, and THEN crash in a plugin (e.g. report
       plugin failing to open the -output file). The header-presence
       check would falsely read healthy. Keys instead on any
       `+ ERROR:` line — nikto's own error-line convention.

       IMPORTANT — nikto routes `+ ERROR:` lines to STDERR (verified
       on scan_run c14e2fe2: stderr was 221B starting with
       "+ ERROR: Unable to open '' for write:" while stdout was only
       136B and contained no error). The detector MUST inspect both
       streams; reading stdout alone false-negatived c14e2fe2 the
       first time this detector was written.

       Explicitly excludes `+ ERROR: Host maximum execution time` —
       that's routine time-boxing (the `-maxtime` cap doing its job)
       and would cry-wolf on every capped run, repeating the
       nuclei-empty mistake. Per Howie's rule: a degraded flag must
       mean tool FAILED, never "tool worked within its budget."

       Does NOT key on `rc` alone. `-maxtime` can set rc != 0 even
       when the scan was healthy.

    3. **module_not_found / no_scan_output** (added 2026-06-10 after
       scan_run 47bbdbff): upstream nikto dies AT STARTUP when a
       required Perl module is missing, printing bare
       `ERROR: Required module not found: JSON` lines — note: NO
       leading `+ `, so the `+ ERROR:` check (shape 2) never fires.
       This is exactly the failure the advisor warned about when the
       apt→upstream binary swap landed ("detector tuned against apt
       2.1.5 — verify still fires on upstream"): it stamped ok:true
       on runs a981526e (6/9, the 0864fd3 mint evidence) and 47bbdbff
       (6/10) where nikto scanned NOTHING. Durations told the truth:
       apt-nikto testfire runs ~1040-1060s; both upstream runs ~485s
       — a real nikto pass had silently vanished from the runtime.

       Two checks close the class:
       a. exact-phrase `Required module not found` → module_not_found
       b. positive-evidence fallback: rc != 0 AND no "Nikto v" banner
          in stdout → nikto never even started → no_scan_output.
          Cry-wolf safe: maxtime-capped runs print the banner before
          rc goes non-zero; healthy runs have rc == 0.

    4. **target_error_limit** (added 2026-06-15 after scan_run
       78a94f11): nikto has its own internal 20-consecutive-errors
       budget. When the TARGET (not nikto's own machinery) rejects 20
       requests in a row, nikto emits TWO specific stderr lines and
       quits gracefully with partial coverage:
         + ERROR: *** Error limit (20) reached for host, giving up. ***
         + ERROR: *** Consider using mitmproxy to avoid TLS fingerprinting. ***
       Surfaced on myordersauth-test (Azure App Service + Entra) — nikto
       ran 444s, reached ~5% coverage, hit the error limit, terminated
       with partial findings ("3 errors and 4 items reported").

       DESIGN NOTE (advisor 2026-06-15, important): this is its OWN
       degraded reason — NOT runtime_error, NOT 'ok'. Three states:
         - 'ok'                 → tool worked within OUR budget
         - 'runtime_error'      → tool CRASHED (Bug E class)
         - 'target_error_limit' → TARGET blocked us partway through
       Tempting trap: route error-limit to the maxtime-style exclude
       list and mark clean. WRONG. maxtime = "worked within OUR -maxtime
       budget" (clean is honest). error-limit = "target blocked us at
       5% coverage" (incomplete is honest). Per this detector's docstring
       rule: 'a degraded flag must mean tool FAILED, never tool worked
       within its budget.' A target-blocked partial-coverage run with
       5% reach is NOT "worked within budget" — it's incomplete because
       of an external denial. Treating it as 'ok' would re-create the
       success-shaped-lie class.

       Implementation: priority order matters. Check error-limit FIRST
       (more specific), then fall through to the generic `+ ERROR:`
       runtime_error catch. The error-limit pattern is two distinct
       lines that appear together; matching either marks the run.

    Verified post-fix against stored fixtures (all in scan_run history):
      - 7f8b18e8 / 1256B help banner (pre-Bug-D-fix) → help_text_returned
      - c14e2fe2 / rc=2 write-crash (stderr 221B)   → runtime_error
      - 7bd3bbf9 / healthy 1595B scan output         → ok
      - 47bbdbff / rc=1 module-not-found (85B stderr) → module_not_found
      - synthesized maxtime-only run (header + items + Host max exec
        ERROR + clean End Time) → ok (cry-wolf guard)
      - 78a94f11 / 148B "Error limit (20) reached" stderr → target_error_limit

    #30 hardening over the original first-fail-rotates loop:
      1. PRE-ROTATE RETRY — before rotating on an unhealthy check, do
         PRE_ROTATE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS probes with PRE_ROTATE_RETRY_DELAY_S
         between. Only rotate if ALL fail. Filters transient curl
         timeouts that tore down working tunnels on scan_run 57a79615.

         POST_ROTATE_SETTLE_ATTEMPTS probes with POST_ROTATE_SETTLE_
         DELAY_S between (~15s total). wireguard-go's first handshake-
         to-target often isn't routing for several seconds after
         bringup; single immediate probe would false-negative.

    Validate-mode override (batch 2 step c, SPEC Part 3): when
    ctx.validate_mode is True, force `max_rotations=0`. The validate
    run is PRISTINE-or-NOTHING for ROTATION — no rotation, no
    pool-swapping. RETRIES still apply (per #30 2026-06-16 follow-up):
    pre-rotate retry filters transient curl blips; that's NOT
    laundering a real degradation event, that's filtering network
    noise. The "no laundering" discipline is about not letting a

    findings emitted (any -mc-matched status: 200/204/301/302/307/401/403).

    Pre-2026-06-07 PM: this function hard-filtered to 200/204 only, silently
    discarding 30x/401/403. The 2026-06-07 demo.testfire.net validation
    (scan_run 59ad6a13) surfaced the bug — ffuf discovered /admin, /swagger,
    /static, /images (all 302→/login.jsp on a Java/Tomcat target), the
    parser correctly populated `results`, but the 200/204 filter dropped
    all 4 findings and findings_added=0. End-to-end runner proof failed
    on a real positive-control target.

    Un-filtered now — ffuf's `-mc` allowlist is the trusted source of
    truth, the Python side trusts it. All -mc-matched statuses produce
    findings, titles vary per status class so the human triage signal
    isn't homogenized.

    NOT YET FLOOD-SAFE FOR WAF-FRONTED ASSETS. The un-filter is correct
    on no-WAF targets like testfire (4 hits → 4 findings). On Cloudflare/
    FortiGate-fronted assets (cc/cmi/unimac/ccc) where 403/302 is the
    norm, this could emit dozens of low-signal findings per scan and
    re-flood the dashboard we just spent today de-phantoming. Land the
    per-scan cap + WAF-rollup logic (see Tasks #3 + #4) BEFORE medium
    runs against any owned WAF-fronted asset.

    Also pending — severity tuning (Task #5): blanket-INFO buries
    high-signal hits (401 on /admin, 200 on /.env or /.git) in the
    noise floor. Sensitive-path detection + status-aware severity
    should be the next layer once the flood guard is in.

    2026-06-13 (batch 2 per-chunk B1 wiring):
      - tools_run.append moved to caller (run_ffuf_chunked) so the
        chunk_name with #index uniqueness lands consistently.
      - chunk_name parameter threads through: existing Layer 1
        mark_tool_degraded calls now stamp chunk_name (not "ffuf") AND
        raise DegradedRunError so Bug A's first-skip-aborts discipline
        holds for tool-specific failures too.
      - Return shape extended to (interesting, out_blob, parsed, stderr)
        so the caller can run Layer 2 is_tool_output_degraded with
        proper post-tool signals.

# 2026-06-07 ADR-001: writes validation_status + scanner_version +
# validated_at on every emission.
#
# 2026-06-13 trust-layer fix (Parts 3 + 4 + Bug D):
#   • Part 3 — DERIVE-ON-WRITE semantics. The old upgrade-only CASE
#     ("once validated, stays validated") let a finding remain
#     'validated' even after the SHA it pointed at was retracted, or
#     after an unvalidated re-emit. The invariant we want everywhere is
#     simpler: validation_status follows the CURRENT scanner_version's
#     active-set membership. Re-emit at retracted/unvalidated SHA →
#     demote to 'unvalidated' + NULL validated_at. Re-emit at validated
#     SHA → promote to 'validated' + stamp validated_at=now(). This
#     keeps the implication chain airtight: derive_validation_status
#     (Part 2) filters retracted SHAs out at read-time; this UPSERT
#     re-derives at write-time; degraded_out (Part 4) demotes on
#     scan-quality flip; the re-sweep (Part 5) heals any historical
#     drift. Advisor leans 1+2 approved 2026-06-13.
#   • Bug D — populate first_detected_scan on INSERT, PRESERVE on
#     UPDATE. Before this fix the column was NEVER written by the
#     runner (only by manual backfills), which made the ce47fc27
#     scan-keyed backfill match 0 rows and turned Part 4's degraded_out
#     update keyed on `first_detected_scan = scan_run_id` into a no-op.
#     The COALESCE protects existing rows: a re-detect by a newer
#     scan_run never clobbers the original first-detection scan_run_id
#     (paired with first_detected_at LEAST semantics).

# ─── finding_history writer (note 129 round 7) ──────────────────────────
#
# After all transition logic runs (UPSERT + delta_close + regress in
# medium; UPSERT + regress in heavy), stamp one finding_history row
# per finding the scan re-emitted. Status captured is the FINAL
# current_status — so a finding that was flipped to 'remediated' by
# delta_close, or to 'regressed' by regress_observed_for_scan_run,
# gets that final value recorded in history (not the intermediate
# status the UPSERT wrote pre-flip).
#
# WHERE last_seen_scan_run = scan_run_id scopes the write to
# findings this scan actually re-emitted — same signal delta_close
# and regress use. ON CONFLICT (finding_id, scan_id) DO NOTHING
# guarantees idempotency: re-running the close-out (e.g., transient
# commit failure + retry) doesn't write duplicates.
#
# scan_id = scan_run_id::text is now safe because the FK to
# legacy scans was dropped in migration 20260629b. Free-text column
# accepts either an offline-import scan_id (existing rows) or a
# scan_run UUID-as-text (new rows from live runs).
#
# CLEAN PATH ONLY. Caller chooses when to invoke this — typically
# from close_out (medium) or run() clean branch (heavy) AFTER all
# status flips have landed. Calling from a degraded close-out would
# stamp history rows whose status field can't be trusted (a degraded
# scan's last_seen stamps are partial / inconsistent), so the
# convention is: don't.

      1. tool_status-only keys → append to tools_run. The stamp is

         BEFORE the per-chunk tools_run.append); we trust the stamp
         and let tools_run catch up.

      2. tools_run-only entries → stamp `degraded:no_status_recorded`.
