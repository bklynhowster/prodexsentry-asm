"""test_scanner_image_pinned.py — the production scan path must not float.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-07). `scanner.yml` pulled
`prodexsentry-scanner:latest` while the comment directly above that line
read "Pin to a date+sha tag in production; bump explicitly when the image
is rebuilt." The intent was written down and never implemented, so every
image rebuild silently swapped the scanning image under production.

The harm is not "builds aren't reproducible." A tool or nuclei template
that changes upstream can make a finding DISAPPEAR, and the finding
lifecycle records that as REMEDIATION — a false-remediation path no gate
catches, because the scan ran perfectly and every phase reported ok.

Pinning docker/Dockerfile (test_toolchain_pinned.py) stops the TOOLS
drifting between builds. Pinning this tag stops the IMAGE changing
without a commit. One without the other leaves the door open.

Deliberately narrow: this does NOT check that the pinned tag is the
NEWEST build. Choosing when to move production is a human act, and the
commit that bumps the tag is the record of when the scanning surface
changed. This only refuses the state where nobody chose.

⚠ Scope: the production scan path ONLY. The 8 diagnostic/canary
workflows (fortigate-*, vpn-egress-*, toolchain-inventory) deliberately
stay on `:latest` so they keep exercising the newest build — that is what
a canary is for.
