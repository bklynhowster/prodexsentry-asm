# vpn_bringup.sh — Mullvad WireGuard bring-up on a headless Linux runner.
#
# PIVOT 2026-05-30: After scans #43-48 with Mullvad's official CLI all
# hung in uninterruptible socket I/O ('D' state) ignoring SIGKILL —
# defeating every timeout wrapper we tried — we pivoted to direct
# WireGuard configuration files. The Mullvad daemon is overkill for our
# use case; we just need a tunnel.
#
# Architecture:
#   1. Install wireguard-tools (standard Ubuntu package, no Mullvad repo)
#   2. Configs are pre-staged in /etc/wireguard/ by scanner.yml
#      (downloaded from the vpn-tools GH release tarball)
#   3. wg-quick up <region>  — ~200-line bash script, no daemon
#   4. Verify routing via `ip route` (local, never blocks)
#
# Required: nothing in env — configs are file-based
#
# Optional env:
#   VPN_REGION — short region name matching /etc/wireguard/<region>.conf
#                Default: "us-nyc"
#                Available (per the tarball we ship):
#                  us-nyc, us-chi, us-atl, us-dal, us-lax
#
# Outputs (to $GITHUB_OUTPUT when running under GH Actions):
#   vpn_region       — region we connected to
#   vpn_egress_ip    — verified post-VPN egress IP (3 providers, 3 attempts)
#   vpn_baseline_ip  — runner's pre-VPN IP for comparison
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — tunnel up, egress change VERIFIED
#   1  — wireguard install failed
#   2  — wg-quick up failed
#   3  — VERDICT: egress didn't change (traffic not routed through wg)
#   4  — egress IP unreadable after retries — cannot verify (no fail-open)
#   5  — no pre-VPN baseline captured — nothing to compare against

# verified against, which is backwards for a safety gate.

# dpkg post-install systemd activation, etc.). They're now baked into
# the scanner container image (see [[59 - Container Image Build Spec]]).

# ─── Step 6: Verify egress actually changed — SAFETY GATE, no fail-open ──
#
# 2026-07-29 (gate audit, docs/gate_criticality_matrix.md). This previously did
# ONE curl to ipify and, if that curl failed, logged "continuing — tunnel is up
# per wg-quick" and PROCEEDED with the comparison skipped. That is a fail-open
# in a safety gate: a single flaky HTTP request was enough to let a scan run
# with egress UNVERIFIED — potentially over the naked GitHub runner IP, which
# is the exact thing this gate exists to prevent.
#
# wg-quick's exit code and `ip route` only prove the interface came up. They do
# not prove traffic leaves through it; a wrong route table satisfies both and
# still egresses on the runner's own address.
#
# Verdict vs transport, same invariant as gate_retry.py:
#   IP changed          -> VERDICT pass   -> proceed
#   IP unchanged        -> VERDICT fail   -> exit 3 (was already correct)
#   IP unreadable       -> TRANSPORT      -> retry; if still unreadable, exit 4
#   no baseline to compare -> UNVERIFIABLE -> exit 5
# 4.7 G4 is categorical: safety gates never fail open, and there is deliberately
# no env var to override this. Blocking a scan costs a cadence slot; scanning
# someone else's infrastructure from an unapproved address costs a lot more.
