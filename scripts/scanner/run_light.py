run_light.py — Phase 4a M3 Light tier scanner

Consumes a scan descriptor (produced by poll_queue.py — see M2), runs the
Light tier check suite against the asset, writes findings + raw artifacts
to Supabase, and closes out the scan_run with status='complete' (or 'failed'
if something blew up).

LIGHT TIER PHILOSOPHY:
  • Passive HTTPS only — no active payloads, no fuzzing, no auth flows
  • Fast (~30-60 sec per asset)
  • IronPort-equivalent safe — nothing here should ever trigger a WAF
  • Catches the high-signal config/posture issues:
      - TLS cert about to expire / weak signature
      - Missing security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame, X-Content-Type, etc.)
      - Common dev-leak paths exposed (.git, .env, /admin, etc.)
      - DNS posture (DMARC, SPF, DKIM)
      - Tech disclosure (httpx -td)
      - HTTP methods that shouldn't be enabled (TRACE)
      - Static CSP nonces (caught CCC M-02)

CHECKS RUN (in order):
  1. tls_check         — openssl cert chain inspection
  2. headers_check     — 7 security headers presence
  3. common_paths      — 8 well-known leak paths
  4. dns_posture       — DMARC / SPF / DKIM via dig
  5. httpx_tech        — tech detection (informational)
  6. methods_check     — OPTIONS / TRACE / etc.
  7. csp_nonce_check   — static-nonce detector (NEW for Phase 4a)

USAGE:
  python scripts/scanner/run_light.py /tmp/scan_descriptor.json

ENVIRONMENT:
  SUPABASE_DSN — required (or pass --dsn)

EXIT CODES:
  0 — scan ran (findings written, scan_run closed). Findings may be 0; the
      run is still counted as 'complete'.
  1 — fatal error (DB unreachable, descriptor invalid, etc.). scan_run is
      marked 'failed' before exit so the row is never left stuck 'running'.

# ─── Behavioral probes (P-behavioral-probes, 2026-05-31 PM) ─────────────
#
# Targeted HTTP probes that detect bespoke / stealth / app-logic findings
# that neither nuclei templates nor version-fingerprint APIs can catch.
# Each probe is a small function that does specific HTTP requests and
# appends a LightFinding if its match conditions are satisfied.
#
# Three classes of finding this track exists to cover (advisor brief #3,
# 2026-05-31 PM):
#   1. Stealth-by-design plugins (WPS Hide Login — hides itself from
#      fingerprinting; wpvulnerability.net can't see it)
#   2. Bespoke app-logic vulns (CCC class — hardcoded keys, static
#      nonces, auth bypass) — already partially covered by check_csp_nonce
#      and check_methods, behavioral_probes is the home for new ones
#   3. HTTP-method / WAF-bypass classes (URL-encoded traversal, etc.)
#
# Design rules:
#   - Each probe self-gates: if the target doesn't look like its
#     applicable surface (e.g. non-WordPress site for a WP-specific
#     probe), the probe returns without appending a finding.
#   - Each probe is single-purpose (one finding type, one match condition).
#     Don't conflate multiple checks in one probe — makes testing painful.
#   - Probes are LOW-VOLUME (≤5 requests each). Light tier hard caps
#     total request count across all checks.
#   - Probe registry below grows over time as we accumulate the inventory
#     from Mac deep-probe-v2.sh + CCC scan history + future findings.

    """CVE-2024-2473 — WPS Hide Login plugin bypass via ?action=postpass.

    REWRITTEN 2026-06-01 PM after a false-positive audit caught the
    original logic flagging any WordPress site behind any WAF.

    PRIOR LOGIC (broken — kept here as a cautionary record):
      Step 1 used a bare 'Mozilla/5.0' scanner UA and accepted 403/404
      as "hiding plugin active." But every common WAF (Cloudflare bot
      challenge, Pressable nginx, Fortinet) returns 403 to scanner UAs
      regardless of plugin presence. Step 2 accepted 302 to /wp-login.php
      as "bypass disclosure," but that's standard WordPress unauthed
      redirect behavior — every WP site does this. Net result: probe
      false-positived on every WordPress site behind any WAF.

    NEW ANCHOR: browser-UA on /wp-login.php.
      WPS Hide Login actively HIDES /wp-login.php — when configured, a
      real-browser GET returns 404 (URL is not reachable, login moved
      to a custom path). If a browser gets 200 back with the WordPress
      login form, NOTHING is hidden — CVE-2024-2473 is logically
      impossible. Definitive negative; bail immediately. Anything other
      than 200/404 (403 / 5xx / redirect / etc.) is inconclusive; bail
      rather than risk another FP class. Tightening trades false
      negatives for zero false positives — the correct tradeoff per
      Howie's standing rule.

    DETECTION (only fires when Step 1 confirms hiding is real):
      Step 2 — GET /wp-admin/?action=postpass with browser UA.
      The buggy plugin fails to apply hiding to this specific redirect,
      so the response is a 302 whose Location header still names
      /wp-login.php — disclosing the path that should have been kept
      hidden. Status 302 + 'wp-login.php' in Location = match.

    NEGATIVE FIXTURES GUARANTEE: any site whose /wp-login.php returns
    200 to a browser cannot be flagged. CMI, commanddigital, and
    unimacgraphics all confirmed clean 2026-06-01 by direct curl;
    they're wired in as negative fixtures and verify_probes.py enforces
    that this probe returns 0 findings against them on every run.

    POSITIVE FIXTURE: NONE. ⚠ POSITIVE-UNVALIDATED STATUS.
    The prior CMI positive fixture (F-10 manual finding) was itself a
    false positive — F-10's 5/04 evidence cited the same broken signals
    this rewrite eliminates (scanner-UA 403 + postpass 302 = "vuln
    present"), with no browser-UA confirmation and no plugin in the
    enumerated inventory. F-10 was assumed-true and validated the
    probe; the probe then re-amplified the assumption across the
    fleet.
    This rewrite has been proven NOT to over-fire (three negative
    fixtures, all clean). It has NOT been proven to detect a real
    WPS Hide Login ≤ 1.9.15.2 bypass. Treat any future match against
    this probe as a HYPOTHESIS pending manual verification, not a
    confirmed finding, until at least one positive fixture has been
    captured against a known-real instance.

    Why nuclei misses this: existing cve-2024-2473 template uses a POST
    to /wp-login.php?action=postpass + body match — different request
    shape. Behavioral probe complements that template when its
    conditions also hold (browser sees 404 on wp-login).

def probe_static_csp_nonces_per_directive(ctx: ScanContext) -> None:
    """M-02 class — detect static CSP nonces, per-directive.

    The existing check_csp_nonce only captures the FIRST nonce in the
    CSP header (typically script-src). When script-src is randomized but
    other directives (style-src, etc.) keep static nonces, the first-only
    check misses the live vulnerability. Empirically verified 2026-06-01
    against test.commandcommcentral.com: script-src nonce randomizes per
    request (remediated), but style-src has 10 static 'CSS_10001'..
    'CSS_10010' nonces across every request.

    Detection logic:
      1. Fetch / 5 times with cache-busting headers
      2. Parse the Content-Security-Policy header into directives
      3. For each directive that uses nonce-based CSP (script-src,
         style-src, etc.), extract its nonce values
      4. Compare nonces of each directive across the 5 requests
      5. Flag any directive whose nonces are IDENTICAL across requests
         — that's a static nonce defeating CSP for that resource class

    Each affected directive gets its own finding so the dedup engine
    can track them independently and remediation status per-directive is
    visible in the portal.

    Why this is a behavioral probe (not just a header check):
    requires SAMPLING across multiple requests to compare nonces. Single-
    request inspection can't tell static from random.

    Architecture note: this probe runs against the homepage (the
    target's most-allowlisted endpoint), so it survives FortiGate-style
    path filtering. M-02-class findings live in response HEADERS, which
    are returned for every allowlisted-path response.

    """Detect hardcoded crypto keys / weak crypto patterns in client-side
    JavaScript that the app actually serves.

    Architecture (matters for WAF-protected targets):
      1. GET homepage with browser UA → parse <script src=...> references
      2. For each referenced .js file, GET it (also browser UA) → grep
         response body for hardcoded-key patterns
      3. Flag a finding per high-confidence match

    Why follow app's reference chain instead of guessing /Scripts/aes.js
    style paths: FortiGate (and similar WAFs) maintain a path allowlist.
    Arbitrary file-path probes get filtered (403/Invalid Request) before
    they see the file. App-referenced asset paths are allowlisted because
    the app actually serves them — those GETs survive the WAF.

    Verified 2026-06-01 against test.commandcommcentral.com (FortiGate):
      GET /Scripts/encryption.js → 200 OK (referenced from homepage)
      GET /Scripts/jquery.js     → 403 Invalid Request (NOT referenced)
      GET /Scripts/aes.js        → 403 Invalid Request (dead-code leftover)

    The probe will correctly NOT match against test.ccc today because
    C-01 was remediated 2026-05-02 (encryption.js migrated to AES-256-GCM
    + Web Crypto API). Probe value is fleet-wide application to future
    findings of this class, not retroactive discovery on remediated assets.

#
# The original Light tier was HTTPS-only — useless for SSH/SMTP/FTP/mail-
# relay assets (Howie's design call 2026-05-28 night). M3 revision:
#   1. port_scan() does naabu top-100 to discover what's actually open
#   2. HTTPS suite stays unchanged but only fires when port 443 is open
#      (or as a fallback when port scan returns nothing — covers
#      firewalled environments where naabu can't reach)
#   3. New per-service checks fire when their respective ports are open:
#        check_ssh    on 22, 2222
#        check_smtp   on 25, 465, 587, 2525
#        check_ftp    on 21
#   4. asset_kind from the descriptor can force checks even when the
#      port wasn't seen — e.g. "mail-relay" kind always runs SMTP
#      probing on 25/587 regardless of scan result.
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
