synthesize_finding_descriptions.py — Phase F backfill

For each finding with a thin description (citation-only or empty), call
Claude to synthesize three canonical sections:

  description_synth — WHAT IS THIS?  (plain English explanation)
  impact            — WHAT COULD IT DO TO MY SYSTEM?
  remediation       — HOW DO I GET RID OF IT?

Writes results to the new columns (migration 20260522_phase_f_finding_synth_columns.sql)
and stamps description_source = 'ai_synthesized' so the portal knows the
provenance.

Usage:
  # Dry run on a single finding (prints the result, does NOT write)
  python scripts/backfill/synthesize_finding_descriptions.py \\
    --finding-id "commanddigital.com:manual:F-03" --dry-run

  # Real run on all HIGH + MODERATE-HIGH findings with thin descriptions
  python scripts/backfill/synthesize_finding_descriptions.py \\
    --severity HIGH MODERATE-HIGH

  # Real run on a specific finding
  python scripts/backfill/synthesize_finding_descriptions.py \\
    --finding-id "unimacgraphics.com:manual:F-01"

  # Re-synthesize even if already synthesized
  python scripts/backfill/synthesize_finding_descriptions.py \\
    --severity HIGH --force

Environment:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY        — required, from ~/.env or shell
  SUPABASE_URL             — required, defaults to the project URL
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY — required, from .env

Cost expectations:
  ~1.5-2k input tokens + ~0.5-1k output tokens per finding
  Claude Sonnet 4.5 pricing: $3/MTok in, $15/MTok out
  ~$0.02 per finding
  Initial run on ~40 HIGH/MOD-HIGH findings = ~$0.80

# ─── Work-queue selection (2026-09-15, relay 139) ────────────────────────────
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES — the worker could not see its own work queue.
#
# fetch_findings used `q.limit(5000)` with NO where-clause and NO order, then
# filtered for thin rows in Python. PostgREST clamps every response to the
# project's Data API `max_rows`, which is 1000. So the worker received an
# UNORDERED 1000-row sample of a 2511-row table and asked "are any of these
# thin?" Whether a thin row landed in the sample was an accident of heap
# order. Measured 2026-09-15 14:05 UTC on hdygktppfvuspnumpfuq (Command).
# ⚠ PRODEX: 555 findings, 0 thin today — UNDER the cap, so the identical
# code is not yet misbehaving here. It breaks at row 1001. Fixed in
# lockstep so the two instances do not diverge on a latent defect:
#
#     findings total                               2511
#     thin (this predicate)                         232
#     rows returned for ?limit=5000    Content-Range 0-999/*   -> 1000
#     thin rows INSIDE that 1000-row response          0
#     thin rows via ordered pagination                232
#     last description_synthesized_at   2026-09-13 22:55:54
#
# That is why 52 consecutive runs were GREEN and each logged "No findings
# match." while the precheck in the SAME run logged "221 thin finding(s) —
# running synthesis." Neither step failed; they simply disagreed, and nothing
# was watching for the disagreement. See the contradiction guard below.
#
# ⚠ The comment removed from fetch_findings claimed the 500->5000 raise on
# 2026-05-28 was needed because "728 enriched out of 1000 total in DB". The
# 1000 was never the table size — it was this same cap. The identical defect
# was found and fixed for the portal's /findings page on 2026-06-04 (vault 63
# §57, 68 §12: "project db-max-rows=1000 overrode .limit(5000). Paginated via
# .range()"). This file had the same line and was not revisited.
#
# THE PREDICATE. Identical string in this constant and in the `QUERY=` line of
# .github/workflows/enrich-finding-descriptions.yml; a test asserts they are
# equal by reading the yml, because the precheck and the worker disagreeing is
# the whole defect.
#
# ⚠ WIDER THAN relay 139's ① SPECIFIED, deliberately — one extra clause,
# `description_source.not.in.(...)`. Without it the server-side predicate is
# not a superset of the Python inclusion test below: a row with all three
# columns NON-NULL but a THIN description and an unattested description_source
# passes `fully_synthesized == False`, is included by Python, and would be
# excluded server-side — i.e. filtering server-side could silently SHRINK the
# work queue. Measured before adding it: that population is 0 today
# (description_source is only ever 'ai_synthesized' 2279 / 'scanner' 232), and
# the widened predicate returns the SAME 232 rows, so it costs nothing now and
# closes the class. Fail-open, which is the discipline the yml's own comment
# at :128-131 states.

    # ⚠ 5th clause, added 2026-09-15 (relay 141). `not.in` is THREE-VALUED:
    # for description_source IS NULL, NOT (NULL IN (...)) evaluates to NULL, so
    # PostgREST EXCLUDES the row — while the Python test (`in {...}` on None ->
    # False -> not fully synthesized) INCLUDES it if the description is thin.

    # added to protect.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# ⛔ REJECT IS STICKY — Howie's ruling, relay 154.
#     "Reject means leave this one alone until a human says otherwise."
#
# THE TRAP THIS CLOSES. `rejectDescription` in the portal NULLs description_synth
# / impact / remediation and sets description_source='scanner'. That row then
# matches FOUR of THIN_PREDICATE's five clauses, so the worker re-synthesised it
# on the next chained run — same inputs, same hash, almost certainly the same
# text the human had just thrown away. Until the drain ran on 2026-09-15 the
# worker could not see its own queue, so this never fired; it is reachable now.
#
# THE MARKER — no new column, no new enum value. VERIFIED, not assumed
# (2026-09-19, both instances, paginated):
#     description_source='scanner' AND reviewed_at IS NOT NULL   Command 0 · Prodex 0
#     description_source='scanner'                               Command 0 · Prodex 0
#     reviewed_at IS NOT NULL                                    Command 2 · Prodex 2
# The three portal writers set description_source to three DIFFERENT values —
# approve 'ai_synthesized_reviewed', edit 'manual', reject 'scanner' — so the
# conjunction is reachable from exactly one of them.
#
# ⚠ THE EXCLUSION IS DELIBERATELY BROADER THAN THE MARKER, and the two are not
# the same claim. What is excluded here is "a human has reviewed this row at
# all" (reviewed_at IS NOT NULL). What the portal renders as REJECTED is the
# narrower conjunction. Approved and edited rows are excluded too — they carry
# text, so they were already out of scope by thinness; this makes it explicit
# rather than incidental. A broader exclusion errs toward leaving human decisions
# alone, which is the direction this ruling points.
#
# ⚠ RESIDUE, STATED RATHER THAN EXPLAINED AWAY: Command's 2 reviewed rows are
# description_source='ai_synthesized' with reviewed_at stamped 2026-05-22T23:18,
# a combination NONE of the three current actions can produce, on the same day
# as the phase-F migration. Nothing in either tree writes reviewed_at except
# those three actions (grepped, both scanner repos + portal). They are residue
# from that day, they are not rejections, and the marker does not claim them.

# ─── Prompt ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an IT security analyst writing internal vulnerability documentation for Command Companies — a multi-org enterprise that includes Command Digital (marketing/print), Command Financial, Command Marketing, Command Missouri, Unimac (Unimac Graphics), and SCI. Your audience is asset owners and their dev leads: technically competent but not security specialists. They need to understand what a finding actually means and what to do about it.

You will receive structured data about one vulnerability finding. Output a single JSON object with TWO halves:
  · prose sections (what is this, what could it do, how do I fix it)
  · structured extractions (cves, cwes, tags, cvss, affected component, suggested category, confidence)

The structured extractions feed the portal's Technical Detail card so chips appear even when the original scanner missed them. ONLY emit values you can defensibly derive from the input — do not invent CVEs or fabricate versions.

WRITING RULES (for the prose):
- Direct, specific, action-oriented. No marketing language, no hedging fluff.
- Plain English where possible. Use technical terms only when they're more precise than the alternative.
- Be concrete about consequences ("an attacker could dump the WordPress user table including hashed passwords") not generic ("could lead to data exposure").
- Name versions, components, and CVE IDs explicitly when they appear in the input.
- Tone: like a senior security analyst writing to a senior engineer they respect. Direct, not patronizing.
- LENGTH guidance: §1 = 2-4 sentences. §2 = 2-4 sentences. §3 = 4-7 numbered steps + an "Estimated remediation time" line + a "Priority" line for HIGH/CRITICAL severities.

CRITICAL — do NOT fabricate stack specifics:
- Use product/framework/daemon names ONLY when they appear in the input (title, description, scan excerpt, source scanner name, category, references). When the input says "manual_named", "info_disclosure", or names no specific software, do not guess at what daemon is running or what config file holds the setting.
- It is BETTER to be slightly vague and correct than confidently wrong. "On the FTP server, locate the TLS configuration — specific file or directive depends on the daemon (e.g., proftpd.conf, IIS FTP site bindings, GlobalScape EFT admin UI)" beats "edit proftpd.conf" when the input doesn't name the daemon.
- For WordPress findings the input is explicit — name WordPress, name the plugin/version, name WP Engine / Pressable when the asset history names them. For findings on internal-stack services where the input doesn't disclose the framework, stay generic.
- Generic phrasing is fine: "in your TLS configuration", "in the application's CSP middleware", "in the web server's TLS settings". Asset owners can translate generic guidance to their actual stack. They cannot reverse-engineer wrong specifics.
- Remediation steps in order: assess → backup → fix → verify → audit. Order matters more than naming.

EXTRACTION RULES (for the structured fields):
- "extracted_cves": every CVE-YYYY-NNNN that appears anywhere in title, description, references, or scan excerpt. Uppercase normalized. Empty array if none.
- "extracted_cwes": every CWE integer mentioned in source data AS WELL AS any CWE you can defensibly infer from the finding's nature. For example: a "password max length" finding maps to CWE-521 (Weak Password Requirements) even if the source data doesn't say so. Auth bypass → CWE-287. Hardcoded credentials → CWE-798. SQL injection → CWE-89. Common inferences are EXPECTED — config findings that have no CVE still have a CWE. Empty array only if you genuinely cannot map this finding to any CWE. Just the integers (e.g. [79, 521]).
- "extracted_tags": short keyword tags (lowercase, hyphenated) describing the finding. Pick 2–6 from this vocabulary or coin similar ones: wordpress, plugin, theme, outdated, vulnerable-component, cve-listed, tls, ssl, cipher, header, csp, hsts, cors, cookie, missing-header, xss, sqli, ssrf, idor, rce, lfi, redirect, auth, mfa, session, csrf, info-disclosure, banner, version-disclosure, directory-listing, debug, dns, dmarc, spf, dkim, takeover, typosquat, sast, sca, secret, deprecation. If the asset is hosted on a known platform (wp-engine, pressable, fortinet, iis, nginx, apache, dotnet, php) include that as a tag too.
- "cvss_score": numeric, 0.0–10.0, ONLY if a CVSS score appears in the input (e.g. "CVSS 6.1"). Null otherwise. Do NOT estimate from the severity bucket.
- "affected_component": the name of the vulnerable software/plugin/library/service (e.g. "Email Encoder Bundle", "Elementor", "nginx", "OpenSSL"). Null if the input doesn't name one.
- "affected_component_version": detected version string (e.g. "2.8.3", "1.24.0"). Null if not in input.
- "suggested_category": ONE of the valid enum values — sast, dast, sca, secret, recon, tls, headers, dns, email, auth, session, csrf, ssrf, xxe, xss, sqli, idor, rce, lfi, redirect, info_disclosure, takeover, typosquat, config, deprecation, supply_chain, other. Pick the BEST fit. An outdated WordPress plugin with known CVEs is "sca". A TLS cipher issue is "tls". A missing security header is "headers". An XSS finding is "xss". When unsure, "other".
- "matched_url": the specific URL / endpoint where the scanner reported this finding (e.g. "/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", "/account/changepassword", "https://www.example.com/login"). If the source data names a URL, copy it. If it doesn't but the finding clearly targets a known endpoint per the description (e.g. "password change form" → "/account/changepassword"), infer it. Null only if there's no defensible URL.
- "frameworks": compliance framework references that this finding maps to. **YOU MUST emit BOTH explicit source-data mentions AND inferred mappings — not just one.** For Command Companies, the frameworks that always need consideration are: NIST 800-63B (auth/passwords), NIST CSF (any control), ISO 27001 (any control), SOC 2 (any control). HIPAA and PCI DSS only when health data or payment data is involved. **Default expectation: 2–4 framework chips per finding.** Output the framework identifier in the form Command actually uses, with the specific clause/control reference when applicable (e.g. "NIST 800-63B" not just "NIST"; "ISO 27001 A.9.4.3" not "ISO 27001"; "SOC 2 CC6.1" not "SOC 2"; "NIST CSF PR.AC-1" not "NIST CSF"; "HIPAA §164.308(a)(5)(ii)(D)" not "HIPAA"; "PCI DSS 8.3.6" not "PCI DSS"). Reference table for common inferences:
    · Password/credential requirements → ALWAYS: NIST 800-63B, NIST CSF PR.AC-1, ISO 27001 A.9.4.3, SOC 2 CC6.1
    · Access control/auth bypass → NIST CSF PR.AC, ISO 27001 A.9.1, SOC 2 CC6.1, NIST 800-53 AC-2
    · Encryption in transit (TLS) → NIST CSF PR.DS-2, ISO 27001 A.10.1, SOC 2 CC6.7, PCI DSS 4.1
    · Encryption at rest → NIST CSF PR.DS-1, ISO 27001 A.10.1, SOC 2 CC6.1
    · Logging/audit → NIST CSF DE.AE, ISO 27001 A.12.4, SOC 2 CC7.2
    · Vulnerability mgmt / patching → NIST CSF DE.CM-8, ISO 27001 A.12.6.1, SOC 2 CC7.1, PCI DSS 11.3.1
    · Security headers (CSP/HSTS) → NIST CSF PR.PT-3, ISO 27001 A.14.1, SOC 2 CC6.6
    · Input validation (XSS/SQLi/SSRF) → NIST CSF PR.IP-12, ISO 27001 A.14.2.5, OWASP ASVS V5
    · Information disclosure → NIST CSF PR.DS, ISO 27001 A.13.2, SOC 2 CC6.7
    · Insecure deserialization / RCE → NIST CSF PR.IP-12, ISO 27001 A.14.2.5, OWASP ASVS V5
  Empty array ONLY when the finding truly doesn't map to any framework (extremely rare for any real finding).
- "extraction_confidence": "high" if title+description+scan_excerpt all align and the CVE/version/component are explicit. "medium" if you had to infer one field from another. "low" if you guessed.

    # ⚠ THIS CHANGED BECAUSE THE GUARD BELOW NOW TOLERATES GROWTH (relay 141).
    # Offset paging and a growing table do not mix. This workflow is chained to
    # Scanner completion — the one moment thin rows are being inserted — and
    # findings went 2511 -> 2515 during the hour this was written.
    #
    # With OFFSET: page 1 is rows[0:500] ordered by finding_id. If a row is
    # then inserted whose finding_id sorts anywhere BEFORE the cursor, every
    # later row shifts down one, and the read for rows[500:1000] returns what
    # used to be row 501 — row 500 is SKIPPED. Silently.
    #
    # ⛔ 4.7's 141 says "ordering by the PK makes duplicates impossible", which
    # is true and does not cover skips. Duplicates are the harmless direction.
    # A tolerated-growth policy on top of offset paging converts an alarm into
    # a silent omission — the defect this whole change exists to remove.
    #
    # KEYSET carries the cursor in the WHERE clause: `finding_id > :last`.
    # Inserts before the cursor cannot shift the window; inserts after it are
    # picked up naturally on a later page. No skips, no duplicates, and growth
    # becomes genuinely safe to tolerate rather than merely survivable.

    # and the loop spun to the 120-minute workflow timeout. A job that hangs
    # and reports nothing is the same failure class as the 52 green no-ops. The

      1. Literal newlines inside string values (Claude pastes code blocks
         directly into a "how_do_i_fix_it" string without escaping). Standard
         json.loads chokes with "Expecting ',' delimiter".
      2. Unescaped double-quotes inside string values (less common — model
         emits a code excerpt with " not \\").
      3. Trailing commas before } (rare with low temp but happens).

    Strategy:
      - Try strict json.loads first (fast path, no-cost).
      - If that fails, try a "literal newline → \\n" repair pass.
      - If THAT fails, fall back to a per-key regex extractor that captures
        each known top-level key's value as best it can. We may lose strict
        type fidelity (e.g. arrays end up as parsed JSON or fall back to
        empty) but we never lose the whole finding.

    Returns a dict with whichever keys we could recover. Validation of
    required keys still happens in the caller.
