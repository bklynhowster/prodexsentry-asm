synthesize_finding_descriptions.py — Phase F backfill

For each finding with a thin description (citation-only or empty), call
Claude to synthesize three canonical sections:

  description_synth — WHAT IS THIS?  (plain English explanation)
  impact            — WHAT COULD IT DO TO MY SYSTEM?
  remediation       — HOW DO I GET RID OF IT?

Writes results to the new columns (migration 20260522_phase_f_finding_synth_columns.sql)
and stamps description_source = 'ai_synthesized' so the portal knows the
provenance.

Usage:
  # Dry run on a single finding (prints the result, does NOT write)
  python scripts/backfill/synthesize_finding_descriptions.py \\
    --finding-id "commanddigital.com:manual:F-03" --dry-run

  # Real run on all HIGH + MODERATE-HIGH findings with thin descriptions
  python scripts/backfill/synthesize_finding_descriptions.py \\
    --severity HIGH MODERATE-HIGH

  # Real run on a specific finding
  python scripts/backfill/synthesize_finding_descriptions.py \\
    --finding-id "unimacgraphics.com:manual:F-01"

  # Re-synthesize even if already synthesized
  python scripts/backfill/synthesize_finding_descriptions.py \\
    --severity HIGH --force

Environment:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY        — required, from ~/.env or shell
  SUPABASE_URL             — required, defaults to the project URL
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY — required, from .env

Cost expectations:
  ~1.5-2k input tokens + ~0.5-1k output tokens per finding
  Claude Sonnet 4.5 pricing: $3/MTok in, $15/MTok out
  ~$0.02 per finding
  Initial run on ~40 HIGH/MOD-HIGH findings = ~$0.80

# ─── Prompt ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an IT security analyst writing internal vulnerability documentation for Command Companies — a multi-org enterprise that includes Command Digital (marketing/print), Command Financial, Command Marketing, Command Missouri, Unimac (Unimac Graphics), and SCI. Your audience is asset owners and their dev leads: technically competent but not security specialists. They need to understand what a finding actually means and what to do about it.

You will receive structured data about one vulnerability finding. Output a single JSON object with TWO halves:
  · prose sections (what is this, what could it do, how do I fix it)
  · structured extractions (cves, cwes, tags, cvss, affected component, suggested category, confidence)

The structured extractions feed the portal's Technical Detail card so chips appear even when the original scanner missed them. ONLY emit values you can defensibly derive from the input — do not invent CVEs or fabricate versions.

WRITING RULES (for the prose):
- Direct, specific, action-oriented. No marketing language, no hedging fluff.
- Plain English where possible. Use technical terms only when they're more precise than the alternative.
- Be concrete about consequences ("an attacker could dump the WordPress user table including hashed passwords") not generic ("could lead to data exposure").
- Name versions, components, and CVE IDs explicitly when they appear in the input.
- Tone: like a senior security analyst writing to a senior engineer they respect. Direct, not patronizing.
- LENGTH guidance: §1 = 2-4 sentences. §2 = 2-4 sentences. §3 = 4-7 numbered steps + an "Estimated remediation time" line + a "Priority" line for HIGH/CRITICAL severities.

CRITICAL — do NOT fabricate stack specifics:
- Use product/framework/daemon names ONLY when they appear in the input (title, description, scan excerpt, source scanner name, category, references). When the input says "manual_named", "info_disclosure", or names no specific software, do not guess at what daemon is running or what config file holds the setting.
- It is BETTER to be slightly vague and correct than confidently wrong. "On the FTP server, locate the TLS configuration — specific file or directive depends on the daemon (e.g., proftpd.conf, IIS FTP site bindings, GlobalScape EFT admin UI)" beats "edit proftpd.conf" when the input doesn't name the daemon.
- For WordPress findings the input is explicit — name WordPress, name the plugin/version, name WP Engine / Pressable when the asset history names them. For findings on internal-stack services where the input doesn't disclose the framework, stay generic.
- Generic phrasing is fine: "in your TLS configuration", "in the application's CSP middleware", "in the web server's TLS settings". Asset owners can translate generic guidance to their actual stack. They cannot reverse-engineer wrong specifics.
- Remediation steps in order: assess → backup → fix → verify → audit. Order matters more than naming.

EXTRACTION RULES (for the structured fields):
- "extracted_cves": every CVE-YYYY-NNNN that appears anywhere in title, description, references, or scan excerpt. Uppercase normalized. Empty array if none.
- "extracted_cwes": every CWE integer mentioned in source data AS WELL AS any CWE you can defensibly infer from the finding's nature. For example: a "password max length" finding maps to CWE-521 (Weak Password Requirements) even if the source data doesn't say so. Auth bypass → CWE-287. Hardcoded credentials → CWE-798. SQL injection → CWE-89. Common inferences are EXPECTED — config findings that have no CVE still have a CWE. Empty array only if you genuinely cannot map this finding to any CWE. Just the integers (e.g. [79, 521]).
- "extracted_tags": short keyword tags (lowercase, hyphenated) describing the finding. Pick 2–6 from this vocabulary or coin similar ones: wordpress, plugin, theme, outdated, vulnerable-component, cve-listed, tls, ssl, cipher, header, csp, hsts, cors, cookie, missing-header, xss, sqli, ssrf, idor, rce, lfi, redirect, auth, mfa, session, csrf, info-disclosure, banner, version-disclosure, directory-listing, debug, dns, dmarc, spf, dkim, takeover, typosquat, sast, sca, secret, deprecation. If the asset is hosted on a known platform (wp-engine, pressable, fortinet, iis, nginx, apache, dotnet, php) include that as a tag too.
- "cvss_score": numeric, 0.0–10.0, ONLY if a CVSS score appears in the input (e.g. "CVSS 6.1"). Null otherwise. Do NOT estimate from the severity bucket.
- "affected_component": the name of the vulnerable software/plugin/library/service (e.g. "Email Encoder Bundle", "Elementor", "nginx", "OpenSSL"). Null if the input doesn't name one.
- "affected_component_version": detected version string (e.g. "2.8.3", "1.24.0"). Null if not in input.
- "suggested_category": ONE of the valid enum values — sast, dast, sca, secret, recon, tls, headers, dns, email, auth, session, csrf, ssrf, xxe, xss, sqli, idor, rce, lfi, redirect, info_disclosure, takeover, typosquat, config, deprecation, supply_chain, other. Pick the BEST fit. An outdated WordPress plugin with known CVEs is "sca". A TLS cipher issue is "tls". A missing security header is "headers". An XSS finding is "xss". When unsure, "other".
- "matched_url": the specific URL / endpoint where the scanner reported this finding (e.g. "/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", "/account/changepassword", "https://www.example.com/login"). If the source data names a URL, copy it. If it doesn't but the finding clearly targets a known endpoint per the description (e.g. "password change form" → "/account/changepassword"), infer it. Null only if there's no defensible URL.
- "frameworks": compliance framework references that this finding maps to. **YOU MUST emit BOTH explicit source-data mentions AND inferred mappings — not just one.** For Command Companies, the frameworks that always need consideration are: NIST 800-63B (auth/passwords), NIST CSF (any control), ISO 27001 (any control), SOC 2 (any control). HIPAA and PCI DSS only when health data or payment data is involved. **Default expectation: 2–4 framework chips per finding.** Output the framework identifier in the form Command actually uses, with the specific clause/control reference when applicable (e.g. "NIST 800-63B" not just "NIST"; "ISO 27001 A.9.4.3" not "ISO 27001"; "SOC 2 CC6.1" not "SOC 2"; "NIST CSF PR.AC-1" not "NIST CSF"; "HIPAA §164.308(a)(5)(ii)(D)" not "HIPAA"; "PCI DSS 8.3.6" not "PCI DSS"). Reference table for common inferences:
    · Password/credential requirements → ALWAYS: NIST 800-63B, NIST CSF PR.AC-1, ISO 27001 A.9.4.3, SOC 2 CC6.1
    · Access control/auth bypass → NIST CSF PR.AC, ISO 27001 A.9.1, SOC 2 CC6.1, NIST 800-53 AC-2
    · Encryption in transit (TLS) → NIST CSF PR.DS-2, ISO 27001 A.10.1, SOC 2 CC6.7, PCI DSS 4.1
    · Encryption at rest → NIST CSF PR.DS-1, ISO 27001 A.10.1, SOC 2 CC6.1
    · Logging/audit → NIST CSF DE.AE, ISO 27001 A.12.4, SOC 2 CC7.2
    · Vulnerability mgmt / patching → NIST CSF DE.CM-8, ISO 27001 A.12.6.1, SOC 2 CC7.1, PCI DSS 11.3.1
    · Security headers (CSP/HSTS) → NIST CSF PR.PT-3, ISO 27001 A.14.1, SOC 2 CC6.6
    · Input validation (XSS/SQLi/SSRF) → NIST CSF PR.IP-12, ISO 27001 A.14.2.5, OWASP ASVS V5
    · Information disclosure → NIST CSF PR.DS, ISO 27001 A.13.2, SOC 2 CC6.7
    · Insecure deserialization / RCE → NIST CSF PR.IP-12, ISO 27001 A.14.2.5, OWASP ASVS V5
  Empty array ONLY when the finding truly doesn't map to any framework (extremely rare for any real finding).
- "extraction_confidence": "high" if title+description+scan_excerpt all align and the CVE/version/component are explicit. "medium" if you had to infer one field from another. "low" if you guessed.

    """
    Parse a JSON object string that may have model-induced damage.

    Failure modes we've observed in production:
      1. Literal newlines inside string values (Claude pastes code blocks
         directly into a "how_do_i_fix_it" string without escaping). Standard
         json.loads chokes with "Expecting ',' delimiter".
      2. Unescaped double-quotes inside string values (less common — model
         emits a code excerpt with " not \\").
      3. Trailing commas before } (rare with low temp but happens).

    Strategy:
      - Try strict json.loads first (fast path, no-cost).
      - If that fails, try a "literal newline → \\n" repair pass.
      - If THAT fails, fall back to a per-key regex extractor that captures
        each known top-level key's value as best it can. We may lose strict
        type fidelity (e.g. arrays end up as parsed JSON or fall back to
        empty) but we never lose the whole finding.

    Returns a dict with whichever keys we could recover. Validation of
    required keys still happens in the caller.
