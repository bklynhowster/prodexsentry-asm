run_alerter.py — Daily COMMANDsentry posture digest.

Queries the canonical Postgres data layer for status transitions since the
last successful run, renders an HTML + plaintext digest, and emails it via
Resend. Designed to run as a GitHub Actions cron job.

What triggers an item in the digest:
  - Finding history row with status 'confirmed' / 'open' (passed 2-scan
    confirmation) in the window since last run
  - Finding history row with status 'regressed' in the window
  - Asset whose current_risk is CRITICAL / HIGH / MODERATE-HIGH and that
    we haven't already reported in a previous run (deduped via the runs
    table)

Even if nothing fires, the alerter sends a brief "all clear" so you know
it's alive.

Required env vars:
  SUPABASE_DSN       postgres URL (use direct connection or session pooler)
  SENDGRID_API_KEY   from Walter @ Command's SendGrid account
                       (legacy RESEND_API_KEY still honored as fallback
                       during the 2026-05-28 cutover transition)
  ALERTER_FROM       verified Command sender; default
                       CommandSentry@commandcompanies.com
  ALERTER_FROM_NAME  display name; default "COMMANDsentry"
  ALERTER_TO         comma-separated recipient list, e.g.
                       hschneider@commandcompanies.com,howiehow@mac.com

Optional env vars:
  ALERTER_NAME             default 'daily_digest' — keys the runs table
  ALERTER_FIRST_RUN_HOURS  default 24 — how far back to look on the first
                           ever run (when there's no prior success row)
  ALERTER_DASHBOARD_URL    default Supabase dashboard link in the footer

Usage:
  python3 run_alerter.py             # send email + record run
  python3 run_alerter.py --dry-run   # print body + skip Resend + skip DB write

# Watchdog v1 — internal pipeline health checks (added 2026-06-07)
#
# Two checks because they catch DIFFERENT failure classes:
#
#   1. STALENESS (per-asset on the DISCOVERY clock = assets.last_observed):
#      finds confirmed_live + owned assets whose last_observed has aged
#      past the discovery cadence threshold (default 9h = 6h cron + 3h
#      grace). LEFT JOIN to asset_surface so we can show last_seen
#      alongside, but the WHERE filter is on assets.last_observed —
#      asset_surface might legitimately lag if there's a deep-scan
#      rotation policy.
#
#      Catches: scheduled discovery runs that silently stopped firing
#      (the bug that bit us 2026-06-06 → 2026-06-07: 3 missed crons).
#
#      Does NOT catch: assets WRONGLY DEMOTED to ct_ghost. Once an asset
#      is no longer confirmed_live, it falls out of this WHERE clause,
#      so the bug is invisible to this check. Hence check #2.
#
#   2. CANARY (direct sensor on a known-good allowlist):
#      for every scope_verified apex in data/targets.yml, assert that
#      both the apex AND www.<apex> exist in assets with
#      discovery_status='confirmed_live' AND ownership='owned'. Any
#      that don't are flagged BY NAME.
#
#      Catches: real hosts wrongly demoted to ct_ghost (the 2026-06-06
#      19:55 UTC broken-dnsx-gate misclassification of 4 www aliases).
#      Cheap, reuses the scope_verified allowlist we already maintain.
#
# Per Howie 2026-06-07: a global MAX(last_observed) would have missed
# both the partial-cron-stop and the demotion bug. Two narrow checks
# beat one wide check.
